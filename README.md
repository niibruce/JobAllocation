# JobAllocation

Simple implementation of Bin Sorting algorithms applied to the allocation of jobs to a set of compute nodes.

Jobs have requirements such as memory requirement, CPU requirement, storage, and networking bandwidth requirement.

Allocation algorithms used are: first fit algorithm, best fit algorithm, and parameter-optimsed allocation(for example, IOPS-optimised allocation).
